## Who We Are

### Angus L'Herrou

### John Jolly
I'm currently a third-year grad student from the University of Utah. I'm researching compiler optimizations for sparse tensors. This mostly deals with making it work generally for the LLVM MLIR compiler tools. I am also an adjunct professor for Utah Valley University specializing with the Operating System Theory and Compiler Development classes.

In a previous life I worked for SUSE Linux as the s390 kernel maintainer, Infiniband driver package maintainer, and high-performance computing developer. I've worked with Linux in general since the Slackware 0.99 days and I am a big fanboy of open-source software.

My specialties include C and C++, Python, Rust, Bash, and x86 assembly. I love to tinker with SBCs like the Raspberry Pi, RISC-V, and FPGA systems. My IDE is Neovim on Bash with Make or CMake.

In my spare time I play with numbers and astronomy. I enjoy nights with my f4.9 1000mm telescope and days writing code. I keep 1 trillion digits of pi on a hard drive for the occasional madness of it.

For the competition you can find me at https://github.com/mirthfather, and for everything else at https://github.com/jjolly.
