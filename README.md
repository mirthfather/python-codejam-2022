# Python Codejam 2022 - Team Synergistic Sylphs

## Program Ideas
Here is the place to put your thoughs and dreams about how to wow the judges:
* Corrupted Chatbot
  * Accepts input from user, but corrupts the output to the receivers
  * Much like the Captcha text testers
  * Possibly implement an escape room or adventure MUD (multiuser dungeon)
* Laggy Game
  * Multiplayer game that has a 1000ms lag from player input to game response
  * Purposeful lag in either client or server
    * Could putting the lag in the client be exploited?
  * Game ideas:
    * Snake
    * Gather the gems
  * Use pygame for frontend
  * Keep track of player history?
    * Authentication?

## Who We Are

### Angus L'Herrou
I’m currently working as an NLP data scientist and researcher. I’ve been programming professionally
in various capacities for about two years. I've worked on various Python packages designing and
refining library and package APIs, packaging software for release on PyPI, training machine learning
models, and writing scripts to wrangle data from various sources.

My personal GitHub account is [angus-lherrou](https://github.com/angus-lherrou).

### John Jolly
I'm currently a third-year grad student from the University of Utah. I'm researching compiler optimizations for sparse tensors. This mostly deals with making it work generally for the LLVM MLIR compiler tools. I am also an adjunct professor for Utah Valley University specializing with the Operating System Theory and Compiler Development classes.

In a previous life I worked for SUSE Linux as the s390 kernel maintainer, Infiniband driver package maintainer, and high-performance computing developer. I've worked with Linux in general since the Slackware 0.99 days and I am a big fanboy of open-source software.

My specialties include C and C++, Python, Rust, Bash, and x86 assembly. I love to tinker with SBCs like the Raspberry Pi, RISC-V, and FPGA systems. My IDE is Neovim on Bash with Make or CMake.

In my spare time I play with numbers and astronomy. I enjoy nights with my f4.9 1000mm telescope and days writing code. I keep 1 trillion digits of pi on a hard drive for the occasional madness of it.

For the competition you can find me at https://github.com/mirthfather, and for everything else at https://github.com/jjolly.

### Byron Sharman
I'm nothing but a young student who has been coding for a while. In the [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python), I saw something called the "Code Jam" that looked like fun, so I thought I'd try it out! Although I've never used Python in a professional context, it was the first programming language I learned, and I have yet to find one that I like more.

Some of my personal hobbies include listening to Romantic-era classical music (especially, but not exclusively, piano concerti or solo piano works), being a member of a [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team, proofreading Wikipedia, and joining the communities of open-source projects.

You can find me on GitHub at https://github.com/b-sharman.
